# Infinite Runner - A Fun and Challenging Endless Running Game


## Description
Infinite Runner is an endless running game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game puts the player in control of a character navigating through a world filled with obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as possible by jumping over obstacles and avoiding collisions.

## Features
- Dynamic Gameplay: The game offers dynamic and unpredictable obstacles that keep the player on their toes, ensuring each playthrough is unique.
- Hand Gesture Control: In addition to keyboard control, the game incorporates hand gesture control using computer vision to allow players to jump by simply extending their palm in front of the camera.
- Three Levels of Difficulty: The game offers three levels of difficulty, each with its own set of challenges and obstacles to keep players engaged.
- Immersive Background Music: Experience the game with immersive background music that adds to the excitement and adrenaline rush.
  (Note: you can change your music by adding the file to the project and replace the path of that file in line 116 in `main.py`)

## Getting Started
1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/loganihrishi/infinite-runner.git`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install pygame opencv-python cvzone`
4. Run the game: `python main.py`
5. Use keyboard controls (space key) or hand gestures (if enabled) to make your character jump and avoid obstacles.

## Hand Gesture Control
For hand gesture control, you need a computer with a webcam. The game uses computer vision with the OpenCV library to detect palm extension, enabling the player to jump using hand gestures.
